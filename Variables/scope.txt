The first program: 
x = 0 
3.times do
  x +=1
end
puts x

WILL print a value of 3 to the screen. 
x was declared as a local variable, meaning that it can be accessed by the 
inner scope as well as the outer scope.

The second program:
y = 0 
5.times do
  y += 1
  x = y
end
puts y
puts x

WILL print a value of 5 for y, 
because is was initialized in the outer scope. 
It WILL NOT print a value for x because this variable 
was intialized in the inner scope, and as such, 
it cannot be accessed in the outer scope.
