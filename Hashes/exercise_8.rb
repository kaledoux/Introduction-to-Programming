#Given the following error, what do you suspect is the most likely problem?

#Error:
#NoMethodError: undefined method 'keys' for Array

#I suspect that the user most likely tried to call the .keys method on an Array
#This method is used with hashes because values stored in hashes are paired with keys
#In Arrays however, values are stored with indexes, so the keys method will not function
