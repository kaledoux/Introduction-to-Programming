#which rails API doc do you like best and why?

=begin
My personal favorite Rails doc is hosted on devdocs.io
They have a very comprehensize site that allows you to search documentation
for one specific language, or in combination with others.
The documentation is thorough and I had no problem finding any of the items I
was searching for.
https://api.rubyonrails.org was very similar in its layout and content, so
I think I will use this as a back up if devdocs ever goes offline
